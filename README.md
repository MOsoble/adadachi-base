# Adadachi

This terminal game is based off of the 90s fad game [Tamagotchi](https://tamagotchi.fandom.com/wiki/Tamagotchi_(1996_Pet)), where you have an alien pet that you must feed, clean, and play with. The object of the game was to increase its happiness and keep it full until it evolved to its next lifecycle stage and left in a space ship! You won!

I've given you two classes: `Player`, `Adadachi` and a few files to keep your code separated and organized.

In the `main.py` file, I imported the function `play_game()`. Run it and see what you get! As you progress through the instructions, it will break! There are errors! It's up to you to figure out how to remake the methods inside `play_game()` so the game can run again.

From there, you can add more details, methods, functionality. Change up the rules of the game! Add more ASCII art graphics! You can even try changing the `game.py` functions into class `Game` and turn all the methods into classmethods!
